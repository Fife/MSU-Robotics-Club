          computation. For less than 100 robots thread management is not
          beneficial, so here we set it to 0. When set to 0, it means that
          the computation is not parallelized: the main thread does
          everything.

        Experiment configuration:

        - random_seed: seed of the main random number generator. If unset

         The XML tag is set by the REGISTER_CONTROLLER(class, "tag") macro.
         You find it in the .cpp file of your controller.
         For this example, the macro is called in

          Multiple implementations of an actuator are possible. To
          identify which one you want to use, pass it in the
          'implementation' attribute below. When you type the 'argos3 -q'
          command, the implementation is in the square brackets following
          the name of the device:

      In ARGoS, multiple physics engines can run at the same time.
      In this section you say which engines to use for the experiment.
      To know which engines are available, type at the command prompt:

  <!--
      Here you specify the media in use. Media allow robots to communicate.
      In this experiment, robots do not communicate, so no media are
      specified.
      To know which media are available, type at the command prompt:

      $ argos3 -q media
  -->
  <media />

  <!-- ****************** -->
  <!-- * Visualization * -->

  <!--
      Here you specify which visualization to use.
      You can also not specify a visualization at all, in which case ARGoS
      will run without showing anything.
      Having no visualization is useful when you run ARGoS in a batch of
      experiments to collect statistics.
      To know which visualizations are available, type at the command
      prompt:
